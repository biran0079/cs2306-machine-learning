1. Convert dataset into WEKA's arrf format.
	1.1 MNIST dataset
The dataset itself is stored in binary file for the purpose of compression. To make modification of dataset easier in the future, fitst comvert it into fuman readable text file.
MNISTDataToTxt.cpp do this job. For more detail, please refer to the comment of source file.

Then convert text file into WEKA's arff file.
MNISTTxtToArff.cpp do this job. For more detail, please refer to the comment of source file.

	1.2 Semeion dataset
This dataset itself is in human readable format. So just need one step to convert it into arff fotmat.
2. ID3 algorithm
3. C4.5 algorithm
