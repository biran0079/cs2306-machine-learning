WEKA

WEKA is an open source data mining and machine learning tool. It contains many well implemented classification algorithm, which I can make use of in this project so that I can avoid repeating other's work. It also provide comprehensive library and API so that I can integrate those machine learning algorithm in my own JAVA program.
