2 data sets used.

THE MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

This dataset is a subset variable from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size(28*28) image. 
It provides 60000 instances in training dataset, and 10000 instances in testing dataset. Each digit is centered in a 28*28 image, and the grey degree is each pixel of the image is represented by an integer between 0 and 255. 0 means white, and 255 means black. Each instance of the data set is represented by a sequence of 285 integers, the first 284 integer are the grey degree of 28*28 pixels, and the last one integer is the label of each image(which digit it is in the image).
In WEKA, 60000 dataset seems too large to fit into my PC's memory, so I pick the first 30000 instances (denote as MNIST1) as training dataset.
For testing, I use the provided testing dataset (10000 instances).

Semeion Handwritten Digit Data Set
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit

This dataset consists of 1593 records (rows) and 256 attributes (columns). 
Each person wrote on a paper all the digits from 0 to 9, twice. The commitment was to write the digit the first time in the normal way (trying to write each digit accurately) and the second time in a fast way (with no accuracy). 
1593 handwritten digits from around 80 persons were scanned, stretched in a rectangular box 16x16 in a gray scale of 256 values. Each pixel of the each original scanned image was first stretched, and after scaled between 0 and 1 (setting to 0 every pixel whose value was under the value 127 of the grey scale (127 included) and setting to 1 each pixel whose original value in the grey scale was over 127).
Because the number of instances of this dataset is relatively limited, I will uses 2 fold cross validation as suggested by the owner of the dataset.
